<h2>Maltease - Catfolk Inquisitor</h2>
<div class="scroll">
    <p>
	Maltese and her brother, Bogart, grew up in a small village about a week’s ride from Gilmore.
Their parent’s died when they were young. They were raised by their aunt and uncle who barley
acknowledged their presence. Bogart always through that he was meant for greater things. As
soon as he was old enough he convinced Maltese to leave their village for Gilmore.
While in Gilmore, Maltese discovered that their landlord was being strong armed by the
neighborhood gang. On behalf of her landlord, she confronted the gang. Things ended
beneficially for all parties. Word got out about what she did for her landlord and soon everyone
she talked to had a problem and Maltese had solutions. During this time Maltese became a
“fixer”. She could fix any problem. Anything from runaway brides to gaining blackmail, she
could do it for you. She also specialized in setting up deals and becoming a third party
management. She plays the middle man for several legal and illegal organizations. Maltese also
has a person for everything. She became “special friends” with an Alchemist when a client
needed help with a mixture for a swarm repellent. This “special friend” named Scully trained
Maltese in basics Alchemy. Since then she has worked on her own to learn skills as an
Alchemist.
<br/>
About a year after Maltese and Bogart moved to Gilmore, Bogart met Lux Taylor, a daughter of
an influential healer. Her father Edam Taylor procured Bogart a position as a tax collector
position. He traveled throughout the realm collecting taxes for Gilmore. Maltese and Lux did not
get along. Maltese thought that Lux was immure and believed that Lux only married Bogart
because he was someone that could be controlled. Their arguments eventually caused a rift
between Maltese and Bogart and several years passed where the two did not speak.
Ten years later Maltese saw a wedding announcement for Lux. Upon further investigation she
discovered that her brother had been declared dead a year earlier. She was told that he died in a
riding accident while he was traveling. His horse, which was caring a large amount of tax
money, took off and Bogart was unable to get control of the horse.
<br/>
Maltese did not believe this story. She need that her brother was an expert animal handler and
would have known how to settle the horse down. She began to investigate. Bogart’s body and the
money were never recovered. She found that between the two witnesses, one was a soldier who
was suddenly transferred to a northern arctic outpost. His letter is still pending. The second
witness became caught a “fever” a week after his return and died. His journal, that Maltese was
able to procure in a less than legal manor, did not mention her brother’s death but included a
third person, name unknown. It suggested this mystery man might be involved with someone in
this group. Maltese also suspects Lux might have some involvement in her brother’s accident. It
is quite obvious that her two children were not fathered by her brother. And it bother’s Maltese
that Lux would remarry so soon after the grieving period.
<br/>
Five months after discovering her brother’s death, Maltese still feels guilty for what she believes
in abandoning her brother. She wants her brother to receive the proper justice that he deserves

while finding peace at their estrangement and his death. In his name and to discover the truth,
she joins this group in hopes at finding more information about the mystery man.

<h2> Darock - CARN "Human" Gunslinger</h2> 
<div class="scroll">
<p>
    The Carn came from late 90's North America.  They arrived via a Carnival cruise ship, which was torn in half leaving a giant Carn on the front bow.  Carnival was everywhere on the ship but, other cultures would would come to accept the big CARN as defining the people.  
<br/>
The original passenger haul of 2049 people and 821 crew members arrived to the world with very little injury.  The problems didnt begin until a few months in.  With little to no notice people began dying in some of the most bizare ways.  Some would explode, others would turn into piles of cochroaches.  While others still would simply fade until they no longer could interact with the world and vanished.  During this time 0 - 38 CY was known as the age of Chaos.  
<br/>
In 38 CY the Carns, despite thier trials and deaths had increased to about a population of 4000.  A local group of dwarves had stumbled upon the settlement while looking for game and a grove of trees to cultivate.  While the dwarves had no way to communicate with these strange humans they could sense that they had magic poisoning and worked tirelessly to help cure the community.  Many of the dwarves were led to believe that this city had been cursed by a powerful warlock.  
<br/>
Even with the random deaths by magic poisoning had subsided there were new threats in the world that were a difficulty to deal with.  Soon after the group was discovered by the dwarves other races had come upon the same discovery and did not take to the encroching trible lightly.  Dark Elves would take men who were on watch at night to work as slaves in their mines, while Orcs would raid the outskirts of the nation to keep them from expanding through the pass.  This made the community isolated and closed off to the rest of the world.  Lore began to change and evolve as to what was fact about their old world and what was fiction.  The Carn saw this world as a kind of Hell and they were gonna survive it.  38 CY - 85 CY was known as the Age of Fear.
<br/>
From 85 CY the Carn started having generations of children that would begin to form black tattoo like burns in their bodies.  These burns are the magic inside fighting against the antimagic these humans were always holding from Earth.  Technology from the ship even gun-powder never worked once they had arrived but now suddenly this marked children could activate these technologies and make the most dazzling of explosions.  A series of books and a book called a Visual Encyclopedia Britanica showed images of weapons that were capable of using gun-powder to make steel bows.  The Carns had finally found a way to fight back against their invaders.<br/>
85 CY to 108 CY was known as the age of War.
<br/>
The population of the community grew to over 18,000.
<br/>
In 122 CY, Darock Johnson was born to Clyds Dale and Madonna.  He was a curious and troublesome kid, the kind of kid that you thought would be dead by the time he was 6 yet somehow he would always be fine despite the crazy things he would do.  Darok was never the social pariah but neither was he the popular child.  He would just fit in to where ever he was.  Reading the people and mimicking behaviour and norms to be a part of any group he was with.  When he was thirteen he had been a part of the after school Footker Team.  He was very agile and was quickly one of the best range guards in the sport for his age.  
<br/>
Every Carn at the age of 16 joins the military for a 3 year service.  During this time Darok served on the sharp shooters core.  An elite group of gunsmiths who worked more of the gorilla warfare missions.  During that time he learned how to survive with little and in any environment.  He loved it.  While he didn't hate people he never felt like he belonged but out there in the forest he could feel like he was doing something important.  Darok had a lot of victories and a lot of losses but he never let himself be overwhelmed by the carnage that war can bring.  In the Peacebound, the name of the sharp shooter group, Darok served under Hul Kogan, a career military man with no fear for death but no eagerness to get there either.  
<br/>
After the 3 years of Military Carns have 3 choices.they can stay, they can get married settle down take a job. (this is what almost everyone does.) Or they can go on a mission for the people to find a way home.  While no one has ever come back from this choice Darok feels that his experiences have prepared him for that.  An Earthquake that occured 3 months before his military time was up made him more assured as it opened up a pass in the mountains that had previously never been known.
<br/>
Darok and his mission companion an agressively popular brute Peewee Herman, latched up their horses to the wagon and started to move west.  A monster or two and through the pass after 3 days and they thought all their worries were behind them.  In a moment the horses had vanished and the wagon slammed to the ground.  Peewee was not wearing his seat beat because that's the kind of cocky guy he was and was thrown from the wagon.  The horses almost 10 seconds later reappeared torn to shreads body parts missing and guts everywhere.  This was enough to alert a nearby Orc scouting party and with little to no idea of what was going on in the situation Darok leapt from the wagon and sprinted for the nearby forest.  In hot pursuit of him he hoped the Orcs would not notice his wounded companion and they followed after him.  He was able to take out one of the 4 but never could catch breath enough to reload and deal more death.  He came up to a cliff face hoped that fate would hold his hand and jumped.  
<br/>
When he awoke he found himself face down in the sand with a thin lizard like creature trying to pry his backpack off him. Ookie was his name and he had never seen a modern backpack and didn't want to take it just wanted to know how it worked.  Darok showed him and in thanks Ookie gave him a journal to help him understand this world he was about to enter a little better.  Darok shaken and determined decided to continue he quest despite the set backs and followed the river to the closest town.  
<br/>
He was not welcomed quickly and gained a reputation for being the outsider.  This got him arrested the strange storeis he had got him brought to the capitol for questioning and gained the attention of the Empress.

<h2> Ransom - Human druid and <del>Raptor</del>RIP. wolf companion </h2> 
<div class="scroll">
<p>
     <i>“Men are grown mechanical in head and in heart, as well as in hand"
Thomas Carlyle, “The Mechanical Age”</i>
<br/>
<br/>
Randolph was born in the city of Wence, a town high in the pines near the Ötztal Pass.  For generations, the town was at peace while armies and merchants traveled through the more strategic Bremen Valley.  
Randolph’s parents were clockmakers who built beautiful astronomical clocks.  He became a journeyman clockmaker and started his own family.<br/>

One year, an upstart commander thought he could use the Ötztal Pass in a surprise assault on the Hanseatic region.  He marched in, burned the town, conscripted fighting age men, and built a prison camp.
When the army learned that Randolph was a clockmaker, they forced him to build clockwork constructs.  If he followed their orders, his family could live.<br/>

He complied, but eventually the extortion, chemical fumes from his work, and devastation of war convinced him to join an underground resistance.  Through delays, ineffectiveness, defective work, disinformation, and treachery, they worked to undermine the army’s goals for months.<br/>

After much planning, the resistance prepared to subvert the next major battle.  Randolph’s charge was to manipulate the constructs to turn on the army. <br/>

The sabotage was highly successful but Randolph as he fled back to the prison camp.  Randolph to watch his wife and child hanged.  The night before his own execution the resistance attacked and he escaped.
For a few years, Randolph worked with the resistance as a saboteur.  But ultimately the fight left him and his emptiness encompassed him. <br/>

Randolph changed his name to Ransom and lived as a hermit for many years in the wilderness.  He built himself a home, collected bugs, and ambushed travelers who threatened his property.<br/>

One day, he heard noises coming from his trash heap.  When he went out to investigate, he found a large toothy lizard scrounging through his stuff.  Ransom attacked the lizard in a whirlwind of fists and teeth.  The lizard defended with claws and it’s tail, trying to pull away with the food it had snatched.  Ransom fought to pry the food away from the wily lizard.<br/>

When his hand came away, it was covered in a sharp, pungent grease.  Naturally, he licked it.  His eyes lit up when he realized that the creature was trying to steal his stale garlic bread. <br/>

Ransom stopped the fight and proudly professed his love for the buttery baked food. He motioned excitedly and tried to communicate that he could make more.  Somewhere in the crazy arm waving, the lizard seemed to understand and followed him cautiously back to his cabin. <br/>

Over a feast of garlic bread, the two bonded deeply.  Ransom tried naming it until it reacted happily to Annabelle. <br/>

That night, Ransom had a dream.  It was full of vegetation and water and animals and it called to him. The world was out of balance.  Armies were scarring the land, the undead masqueraded as the living, and ancient magic was being manipulated by evil people.<br/>

Annabelle was a sign from the earth.  He would soon see another sign: a bone dragon. The spirits of nature wanted to become a warrior and Annabelle and the dragon would help him. <br/>
The dream filled him with the oneness of nature. For the first time in many years he didn't feel empty. <br/>
The next morning, a richly dressed man appeared down the road.  Ransom knew the road didn't lead anywhere and strangers were most likely to be thieves.<br/>
Ransom leaped wildly out of a thicket.  He screamed at the man to leave but the traveler attacked him.  Ransom fought back and won with a bludgeon to the head.<br/>
He searched the stranger and found a bone necklace, carved with the image of a dragon.  He froze in surprise.  The pendant spoke to him. <br/>
Hypatia told him get story and begged to be taken away.  Ransom told her he had been in the same place for a long time too.  <br/>
But the oneness of nature he felt in his dream filled him up again. The bone dragon was literally in his hand. He told Hypatia he'd help her fulfill her wish and they'd go out into the world together.  <br/>
Ransom gathered some of his things, called Annabelle and departed for the nearest town where he could find transportation.

<h2> Craig - Human Bard</h2> 
<div class="scroll">
<p>
    Craig has no last name.  He was traded to a merchant for by a starving village.  He in turn turned the barely crawling child over to a Knight's training academy for a nights stay in their fort.  He has known this his whole life.  Growing up he was taught the fundamentals of the Knight's order.  Loyalty to those you stand beside.  Duty to the mission.  Respect for all living things.  Selfless Service whenever possible.  Honor over personal desires.  Integrity even at the cost of one's own life.  Personal Courage to the point you carry your shield home or are carried home on it. 
<br/>
This is how he grew up.  Along with training in tactics, various weapons, and physical conditioning.  He lived, breathed, and personified everything a knight was.  Until the day of his first trial to become one.  He was rejected.  His Master's praised his discipline.  His Morality.  Even the camaraderie he engendered among his fellow trainees when most classes before him were bitter rivals.  But a Knight is more than this.  A knight must be able to use Wrath against the darkness.  To Rage in the face of terrible odds.  Many abilities required to be a Holy Knight were activated by strong emotion.  Craig has never felt fear, anger, or joy.  He simply doesn't have the capacity.  Even when sent to his home village to confront his parents and discovering it destroyed by an undead horde he exhibited to reaction.  He simply stated the horde must be destroyed and joined in the hunt to do so.  When teased by his fellows his laughs along with them and carries on like nothing happened.  In good conscience, his master's turned him away from the trials.
<br/>
As he packed his belongings, since only Knight's or squires can live within their walls, his first teacher approached him with an idea.  The whole fort had heard him sing the hymns taught from an early age to push back the bleakness of despair and sorrow.  It had even been commented his voice could be heard from a good ways off.  Thus the suggestion of a new path for Craig was made.  His old teacher handed him a book with the hymns their clerics used to protect themselves, and gave him the name of a tavern he could start his search for a new master.  Bard's had no proper school as far as any of them knew.  So he would need to become an apprentice to one.
<br/>
After traveling with three different Bards and being informed that had nothing left to impart, he struck out on his own.  His first twenty years had been spent studying history, Arcana, ways to fight evil creatures, ways of finding magical items, with descriptions of animal and plant life found in different parts of the world.  Now he was seeing many of this for himself.  He traveled to the forbidden ruins of an undead city and tried to memorize the half circle fortress from afar.  After he was set upon by bandits twice, he decided city life or joining a merchant train was the safest way to travel.  He spoke to all manners of people.  Learning their story and sharing forgotten histories of the cities they had grown up in.  He accepted that many emotions eluded him.  But curiosity was not one of them.  He wanted to know everyone's story and share it with all.

<h2> Reginold - Human Fighter</h2>
<div class="scroll"> 
<p>
When recanting the story years later, he would always say he saw it coming.  His luck was always that bad.  For a time he had been a merchant train guard and made a decent living at it.  But when his best bud was caught trying to force the daughter of one of their bosses into the back of a carriage, he was blamed as well when he tried to stand up for him.  After being sent away, they found themselves in need of work and Reginald had arranged an interview for some bouncer positions at a local fight club.  But when his friend was caught cheating at cards, they were both blamed yet again and run out of town.  After listening to his friends excuses for the last time he stormed away from where they had made camp.  When he returned later, his friend was dead and their camp ransacked.  He quickly fled.  All he had left was the sword on his hip, 3 gold pieces, and the clothes he had worn the last week straight.  It did not take long for the gold to run out and desperation to set in.  He begged a bartender to sweep his place, anything to earn food at least.  Instead he was sent to someone the bartender knew was always looking for strong lads.  Fearing the worst, he swallowed his pride and followed the directions he had been given.  It turned out to be the local slave trader. All he wanted was a meal he agreed to be a gaurd for the pens

caught in the middle of an attack by adventures coming to free on of thier own he was regrettably marked as a slave by one of them. they offered for him to come with them and they would remove the mark.

staying meant death, leaving meant death, "what wonderful luck" he mumbled to himself as he allowed himself to be herded along.
