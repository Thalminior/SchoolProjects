//<![CDATA[
//Goals:  To create a "select" menu generator that can be used to
// place as many menus as you want on a page.
/* Design Requirements
    createMenu():
    	1. Will need 4 parameters
    		
    		
    		
    		targetId  (the name of id from the particular <select name="name"  id="menuname"> 
    			you are trying to create.
    setupStuff():
    	1. You will create 4 menus using your new createMenu()
    		they are days of the month (like before)
    		years (from present to 125 years ago)
    		months (from 1 to 12)
    		numbers (from 25 to 1000)
    		(check in body and you can see id names already)
    	2. for years and days you will use the Date() object to get the values
 I will put comments that say "CHANGENEXTLINE" with hints of what to do
 
 To clean things up, REMOVE the un needed comments after you fix things
 */
//As we do not want to run this before the page loads, use window.onload to
//run a function setupStuff after the page finishes loading.
window.onload = setupStuff;
function setupStuff()
{
	/* creating day menu */
	//moved this from the old createMenu() function
	var today = new Date();
	//Due to the getMonth() method starting at 0 we need to + 1
	var lastDay = new Date(today.getFullYear(), today.getMonth() +1, 0).getDate();
	createMenu(1,lastDay,'Choose a Day','daymenu');
	/*creat birthday menu, going back 125 years */
	var oldYear = //use the today Date objectcreated on line 40 to calculate this
	var thisYear = //also use today Date object to figure this
	//Now put in proper variables and strings into createMenu() call instead of ??
	createMenu(??);
	/* create month menu, note, this really needs an array to do it
	   right. But as we haven't covered this yet, we will just
	   display the months from 1-12 */
	createMenu(??);
	/* and for some reason they need to choose a value from 25 to 1000 */
	createMenu(??);
}
	//CHANGENEXTLINE: need to add the four parameters
function createMenu(startNum,endNum,menuMsg)
{
		//CHANGENEXTLINE: remove 'Choose a Day' and put the proper variable
		//inside (will need to break it up into pieces and use + )
	var strMsg = '<option value="">Choose a Day</option>';
	// CHANGE NEXT TWO LINES:  counter should be set equal to a variable
		// and the while loop probably has the wrong variable name in it
	var counter = 1;
	while ( counter <= lastDay)
	{
		strMsg += '<option value="' + counter + '">' + counter + '</option>';
		counter++;
	}
	//CHANGENEXTLINE: use getElementById with a variable from your parameters
	document.forms[0].day.innerHTML = strMsg;
