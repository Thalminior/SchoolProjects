			<section>
				<h3>Early life</h3>
					<p>Uzata began his life on his home world a farm boy in a small rural village, in one of the larger kingdoms of him home planet to be called manu. Uzata was always reckless as a child and very prone to bouts of extreme anger and violence, something the village elders attributed to his fathers side of the family only recently giving up nomadic life. At the young age of 25 growing restless of this life and with rumors of war and invasion beginning to circulate uzata decided to join his homelands military, after being denied on account of his age he continued to pester the recruitment officer, finally his anger got the best of him and he challenged the officer to a fight, if he won, they would recruit him, if not he would never again bother them. Thinking to end the annoyance the officer agreed. Uzata's anger prevailed that day, blessing him with increased strength, winning the match he joined the military.</p>

				<h3>Military life</h3>
					<p>Over the next 75ish years he honed his military prowess learning to use his anger to fuel him to new heights. Eventually turning back the invading kingdom and continuing on pushing deep into the neighboring eastern country, the border wars lasted many years and uzata was there fighting and killing. Uzata gloried in the mayhem and bloodshed, his rage and unpredictability kept him from gaining much rank, but his homland used him and his squad to do dangerous suicidal missions. All was going well, they were pushing deep into enemy territory being the spear that broke enemy ranks, but that all changed when something in the enemy armies changed, the enemy began winning they seemed to know where they would be attacked and thier men seemed untouchable, almost as if overnight uzata and his countrymen began loosing every battle, uzata and his countrymen were pushed back. As the enemy pushed Deep into thier homelands bypassing uzata he was cut off, him and his men fought bravely to no avail, mortally wounded, lying on the battlefield uzata cried out to gods he had always thought useless, he would serve whomever would spare his life, his cry was answered, but not by his countrymans gods</p>

				<h3>The Offer</h3>
					<p> a god of his easternmost enemy offered to spare his life and grant him great power, in exchange uzata was to wage war for him. Uzata agreed as he cared more for the violence than for whom it was being done. rising from what was to be his grave and gifted by his new god, filled with a newfound terrific rage, uzata waged a terrible war upon his once countrymen, in the name of his new god. Gifted with power he drove the war deep into his former homeland to the great capital city itself, after destroying the great temple, his army's were to move on to the government buildings. However the moment the temple had fallen, the voice of uzatas "new god" told him he had served his purpose and he was done with him. uzata collapsed, the same wounds that had felled him on that past battlefield reappearing. lying in a spreading crimson pool of his own blood his continual rage ebbed. As his mind cleared Uzata realized how he had been betrayed, and had betrayed all he stood for, cursing that god and wishing only for death he lost consciousness. </p>

				<h3>The Vows</h3>
					<p>One night the temple was again attacked, seeing the invaders brungtu went to stop the invaders with words, always saying that though persuasion greater things were accomplished than any weapons. The attack unfortunately was from 2 directions and uzata and the other patent section was quickly filled with assailants killing each patient and healer. uzata called on his rage and pushed his body out of bed, takin an invaders weapon from them striking that man down, he went room to room killing all the assailants all that stood before him, finally as his vision cleared, he realized that he has cut down everyone who could stand, enemy and friends alike. Finding his friend at his feet in the temple sanctuary, was a terrable blow, and he sank to his knees.At that very moment kneeling in his friends blood in the center of temple surrounded by the likeness his country's gods, he determined that he hated the gods, he hated what they did with mortal lives, the wars and bloodshed was all over thier petty squabbling. He made 2 vows that night, 1st: he would never again wield a weapon to hurt another creature. 2 he was going to find a way to make each of these supposed gods before him and the one that had tricked him pay for thier crimes; he would prove them to be powerless and stop thier wars. Shouting his vows at the alters before him, he swore to see each one of them fall. After administering last rights to his only dear friend and all those in the temple he had killed. He collected supplies and left

				<h3>The Plan</h3>
					<p>leaving both countries behind for now, there were other countries, other pantheons. he would find one that did not force its believers to physical war. He understood that gods somehow drew thier power from thier followers and he had a plan: He would take his friends words to heart, more could be done with persuasion than any sword. Knowing he would eventually be a pawn of one "god" or another. Uzata found Gods that would agree to his terms and made a deal: he would serve them, he would be loyal and faithful, he would give all power to them and he would bring them more followers by converting his homeland and all he could, making them even more powerful, in exchange they would extend his life and protect him from harm, even to bringing Him back from death if necessary. he would be thier imortal avatar</p>

				<h3>Revenge</h3>
					<p>Taking the name of brungtu and with these gods behind him he began his work, Over the course of the 800 years he spread the religion of manu across his homeland. Working on atoning for his sins and on bringing down his former homelands pantheon, he struggled at first keeping his rage in check but he had many years to practice eventually he succeeded in undermining the pantheon he had sworn to destroy converting all of its followers weakening them to a point where the eastern god who had betrayed him struck the final blow and destroy them, watching it fall brought some comfort bit he had another to deal with, by this time many revered him as a great prophet he guided them to a conversion of the eastern lands as well, working tirelessly to teach peace, after another 400years that god fell as well and the pantheon uzata served ruled over 80% of his world which his new gods called manu.</P>

				<h3>New Patrons</h3>	
					<p>One day He was approached by an emissary of a god of another sphere, they knew of him, they knew of his work, and they were willing to make a similar deal. for centuries uzata worked for many different gods an agent in their divine wars working to stop mass bloodshed, he understood that the gods were exulted mortals, but no more. He understood that they would fight each other and he participated in those fights he understood there would be killing, he would select his clientele carefully, each knowing the terms of his hire. For each "God" he took upon a new assumed name that he would then give back to them. Uzatas ultimate goal after seeing and participating in the inner workings and downfall of the gods, is to himself become exalted his own independent deification. </p>
